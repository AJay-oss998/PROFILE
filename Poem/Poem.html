            "When love falls apart, silence takes its place, And all that remains is an empty space. We tried our best, but we couldn't see, That we were falling apart, you and me.",
            "I once thought love would never fade, But time has shown that even it can be betrayed. Our hearts once intertwined with grace, Now drift apart in an endless race.",
            "The words we spoke, the promises we made, Now fade away, like memories that fade. The love we had, now feels so small, A once towering flame, now a dimmed call.",
            "I gave you my heart, and you took it in stride, But now it seems, you're no longer by my side. I loved you deeply, more than you'll ever know, But sometimes love is not enough to make it grow.",
            "The love we shared is now a shadow in the past, And I wonder if it was ever meant to last. The echoes of laughter, the warmth of your touch, Have all faded away, leaving me with too much.",
            "I thought we’d be together, forever and more, But love’s door closed, and we’re left on the floor. Our hearts once beat as one, so strong, Now each of us wanders, trying to belong.",
            "The memories linger like a haunting tune, We once were stars, but now we’re just the moon. Our love was beautiful, but now it’s gone, Leaving me lost, trying to move on.",
            "I watched you go, and I couldn't say a word, For the pain I felt was something I never had heard. You left without a trace, without a goodbye, Leaving me alone to wonder why.",
            "Our dreams were built on fragile ground, And when they fell, no strength was found. I held you close, but you slipped away, Now I’m left with the night where once was day.",
            "The tears I shed are silent now, For love has left, I don’t know how. We danced in light, so pure, so true, But now the dance is over, and so are you.",
            "I painted our future with colors so bright, But you turned away, and stole the light. My heart still calls, though you don’t hear, A love once loud, now drowned in fear.",
            "We wrote a story, page by page, But love’s ink ran dry, trapped in a cage. The chapters end with a bitter sigh, A tale of us that had to die.",
            "Your voice once warmed my coldest nights, Now it’s gone, along with the fights. I search for peace in this empty shell, Where once was love, now just farewell.",
            "The bridge we crossed has burned to ash, Our love reduced to a fleeting flash. I stand alone on the other side, With memories of you I can’t hide.",
            "I gave you all, my soul, my trust, But it crumbled down to fragile dust. We were a song, now out of tune, A broken chord beneath the moon.",
            "The stars we wished on lost their glow, Our love slipped through, so fast, so slow. I’m left to wander this endless maze, Haunted by our better days.",
            "You were my dawn, my morning light, But now I’m trapped in endless night. The love we had, so fierce, so bold, Now lies in ruins, silent, cold.",
            "I built a home within your heart, But you tore it down, piece by part. The walls we raised now stand alone, A love once warm, now turned to stone.",
            "Our laughter echoed through the years, Now it’s drowned in unshed tears. I reach for you, but you’re not there, Just empty space and cold despair.",
            "The promises we carved in sand, Washed away by time’s cruel hand. I loved you more than words can say, But you chose to walk away.",
            "We were a flame that burned too fast, A fleeting spark not meant to last. The embers fade, the fire’s gone, And I’m left here to carry on.",
            "Your eyes once held my every dream, Now they’re lost in a distant stream. I call your name, but no reply, Just echoes of a love gone by.",
            "The love we grew was like a rose, Beautiful, yet it met its close. Thorns remain where petals fell, A tale of heartbreak I can’t retell.",
            "I held your hand through storm and rain, But you let go, and I felt the pain. Our path diverged, no turning back, A love once whole, now dressed in black.",
            "We sailed a sea of hopes so high, But waves crashed down, and we said goodbye. The ship has sunk, the waters still, My heart adrift against my will.",
            "The nights we shared beneath the sky, Now feel like dreams that passed me by. You were my world, my everything, Now just a ghost, a broken string.",
            "I wrote your name across my soul, But you erased it, left a hole. The love we had, so deep, so true, Now fades away, like morning dew.",
            "We danced through life, a perfect pair, But now I dance with empty air. The music stopped, the lights went dim, A love story lost to a bitter hymn.",
            "Your touch once set my heart ablaze, Now it’s lost in a foggy haze. I search for warmth, but find none there, Just echoes of a love unfair.",
            "The plans we made, the life we dreamed, Dissolved like mist, or so it seemed. I’m left with shards of what could be, A broken heart, a shattered me.",
            "I loved you with a boundless grace, But you turned from my embrace. The silence grows, the distance wide, A love that lived, then softly died.",
            "We were a poem, sweet and long, But now the rhyme feels all wrong. The verses fade, the pages tear, A love once here, now nowhere.",

            "I held you close, my guiding star, But now you’re distant, oh so far. The sky is dark, the night so long, A love once right, now feels so wrong.",
            "We built a world, just you and I, But it crumbled with a single sigh. The ruins stand where love once grew, A broken me, a missing you.",
            "The whispers of our past remain, A quiet ache, a dull refrain. I loved you more than words can frame, But now it’s just a fading name.",
            "You were my shelter from the storm, A place so safe, so soft, so warm. But now the rain falls hard and free, A love washed out, no longer we.",
            "Our love was like a summer breeze, Gentle, sweet, it brought me ease. But autumn came, the winds turned cold, A tale of love forever told.",
            "I gave my all, my every breath, But you chose life beyond our death. The heart I gave now beats alone, A love once shared, now overthrown.",
            "We walked a path of golden hue, But shadows fell, and we withdrew. The road ahead is mine to take, A love now lost, for my own sake.",
            "Your laughter was my sweetest sound, But now it’s silence all around. I search for joy, but find despair, A love once vibrant, now thin air.",
            "The love we had was like a flame, Wild and bright, it bore your name. But flames die out, as ours did too, Leaving ashes where I once knew you.",
            "I dreamed of us in endless time, A love so pure, a perfect rhyme. But dreams awake to bitter truth, A broken bond from our lost youth.",
            "You held my heart within your hands, But let it fall like shifting sands. I’m left to gather what remains, A love now lost to endless pains.",

            "I gave you words, my deepest plea, But you turned deaf, and left me be. The silence stings, the quiet burns, A love once mine, now lost in turns.",
